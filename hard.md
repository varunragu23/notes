The actual value is used to form the segment tree, and the leaf is stored (count of smaller number). Trick: Query first, then modify. Each time Query, A [i] has not been added to the Segment Tree, and A [i + 1, ... etc] has not been added yet. Then naturally it is coutning smaller number before itself. Tricky! Also note: In modify: Check root.start <= index and index <= root.end. It was ignored in the past. You can also write this later. (In fact, it is Make sense, which is to more strictly check the index and the position in root.left or root.right) --- ** 1.

K people start to copy at the same time from different points. Q. When can I copy it as soon as possible? #### Partition DP -The first step is to understand the problem required by the title: the first k individuals copy n books and find the least amount of time; it can also be translated into: `n books, let k individuals copy, that is, split into k segments`. -Finally, dp [n] [k] is required. On: int [n + 1] [k + 1]. -Principle: -1. Consider the last step: In [0 ~ n-1] book, the last person can choose to copy 1 book, 2 books ...... n books, the results of each cutting method are different -2. Discuss the situation of the kth person, looping at j = [0 ~ i]. And the slowest case when looping j determines the result of the kth person (barrel principle): `Math.max (dp [j] [ k-1], sum) `. -3. Among them: `dp [j] [k-1]` is the result of [k-1] individual reading the j book, which is also known as the `previous step`. The loop considers that the kth person is different j kind of previous step :) -4. The result of the loop is that dp [i] [k] = Math.min (Math.max (dp [j] [k-1], sum [j, i]), loop over i, k, j = [i ~ 0]) -Time: O (kn ^ 2), space O (nk) ##### Init -Init: dp [0] [0] = 0, 0 people 0 books -Use of Integer.MAX_VALUE: -When i = 1, k = 1, Expression: dp [i] [k] = Math.min (dp [i] [k], Math.max (dp [j] [k-1], sum)) ; -There is only one case that works: i = 0, k = 0, exactly 0 people copy 0 book, dp [0] [0] = 0. -In other cases, i = 1, k = 0, 0 people read 1 book, it cannot happen: so use Integer.MAX_VALUE to break Math.max, and maintain ridiculous values. -When the case of i = 0, k = 0 is discussed, the above equation will be calculated according to the actual situation dp [i] [k] -The init of this question is very important and tricky ##### Calculation order -k people, need a for loop; -k people, starting from copy1 book, 2, 3, ... n-1, so i = [1, n], requires a second for loop -On each i, the cutting method can be [0 ~ i], we have to calculate each worst time ##### Scrolling array -[k] only relevant to [k-1] -Space: O (n) #### Binary Search -Based on: How much time does each person spend doing binary search: How long does it take each person to complete it in K people with the least amount of time? -The range of time variable is not index or page size. It is [minPage, pageSum] -Pay attention to 3 cases when validating: people are enough k> = 0, people are not enough so the end is reduced to k <0, and there is a time (the time spent by each person) is less than the current page, return -1 -O (nLogM).

Check if they are scramble string. -scramble string definition: string can be split into binary tree form, that is, cut into substring; -After rotating a node that is not a leaf, a new substring is formed, which is the scramble of the original string. #### Interval DP Interval -Dimension reduction strike, split, dp by length. -dp [i] [j] [k]: array S starts at index i, T starts at index j, is a substring of length k, is it a scramble string ##### Break down -After two halves of everything, look at two cases:, or not rotate the two halves. For these substrings, verify whether they are scrambled. -Two halves without rotation: S [part1] corresponds to T [part1] && S [part2] corresponds to T [part2]. -rotate the two halves of division: S [part1] corresponds to T [part2] && S [part2] corresponds to T [part1]. ##### Initialization -When len == 1, it can't be rotated, that is, to see if the corresponding indexes of S and T are equal. -Initialization is very important.

[NO backtraking in the solution] -DFS returns List <String>: every for loop takes a prefix substring, and append with all suffix (result of dfs) -IMPORANT: Memoization: `Map <prefix, List <suffix variations >>`, which reduces repeated calculation if the substring has been tried. -Time O (n!). Worst case, permutation of unique letters: `s = 'abcdef ....'`, and `dict = [a, b, c, d, e, f ...]` #### Regular DPs -Two DPs are used together to solve the problem of timeout: when a invalid case 'aaaaaaaaa' occurs, isValid [] stops dfs from occuring -1. Isword [i] [j], subString (i, j) exist in dict? -2. Use isWord to speed up isValid [i]: Can [i ~ end] find a reasonable solution from dict? -View i from the end: Because we need to test isWord [i] [j], j> i, and we observe the interval [i, j]; -The part of j> i also needs to be considered, we also need to know isValid [0 ï½ž j + 1]. So isValid [x] is a DP indicating whether [x, end] is valid this time. -i is from the end to 0, probably because it is considered that isWord [i] [j] is within [0 ~ n], so the numbers are reversed and the coordinates are easier to figure out. -(Looking back at Word Break I, there is also a practice of coordinate inversion) -3. dfs uses isValid and isWord for ordinary DFS. #### Timeout Note -Regarding regular solution: Without memoization or dp, 'aaaaa .... aaa' will repeatedly calculate the same substring -Regarding double DP solution: Set.contains (...) is used in Word Break, i is 0 from isValid. However, contains () itself is O (n); [j], judge whether i ~ j exists in dictionary based on O (1) --- ** 14.

Find all the words that can be formed. Condition: 2D matrix can only be positioned next to each other. #### Trie, DFS -Compared with the previous implementation, there are some places that can be optimized: -1. During Backtracking, you can mark on board [] [] instead of opening a visited [] [] -2. You don't need to implement all the equations of the trie, you don't need it: only insert is needed here. -Common trie questions will let you search for a word, but here is a board, see if each letter of the board can come out of a word. -That is: the search here is written by hand, not the traditional trie search () funcombination -3. When there is an end in the TrieNode, the string word is stored, which means the end. When the word = null is used up, the problem of repeated search is just truncated. ##### About Trie -Build Trie with target words: insert, search, startWith. Sometimes, just: `buildTree (words)` and return root. -Still do DFS on the board matrix. -no for loop on words. Directly to board DFS: -Each layer will have an up-to-this-point string. Check if it exists in the Trie. Use this to judge. -If it does not exist, you do not need to continue DFS. -Trie solution time complexity, much better: -build Trie: n * wordMaxLength -search: boardWidth * boardHeight * (4 ^ wordMaxLength + wordMaxLength [Trie Search]) #### Regular DFS -for loop on words: inside, do board DFS based on each word. -Time cpmplexity: word []. Length * boardWidth * boardHeight * (4 ^ wordMaxLength) #### Previous Notes -Big improvement: use boolean visited on TrieNode! -Don't use rst.contains (...), because this is O (n) and timeout in leetcode (lintcode can pass) -In the Trie search () method, mark any visits. --- ** 19.

Open Trie (words) can be directly initalized with for loop A TrieNode can have a List <String> startWith: record all strings that can reach this point: a bit like a tree, ancestor-shaped storage. God operates: According to the nature of square, if list of words is selected, set int prefixIndex = list.size (). Take all the words [prefixedIndex] in the list and add them together to form the prefix of the next word candidate. Image a bit: list = ["ball", "area"]; prefixIndex = list.size (); ball [prefixIndex] = 'l'; area [prefixIndex] = 'e'; // then candidatePrefix = ball [prefixIndex] + area [prefixIndex] = "le"; Here you can use the findByPrefix function of Trie.

For each index, the maximum water column that can be stored vertically is determined by the left and right highest walls: min (leftHighestWall, rightHighestWall)-currHeight. #### Method 2 The optimization above method 1, two pointers, still find the highest left and highest right. O (1) space. The idea used in method 3 is the same: the entire structure is divided by the highest bar in the middle: The left is calculated as maxLeft, and the right is calculated as maxRight. #### Method 3 2 Pointers, double-sided pinch: 1. Find the index of the highest bar in the middle 2. Swipe to the center on both sides: add (topBarIndex-currIndex) * (elevation from previous index) each time. That is, add one horizontal bar at a time. 3. Every time you want to subtract the height of the block itself #### Method 4 The main idea is the same as Method 3: On the basis of the downhill slope, the bottom has been stacked with stacks. Before finally encountering the ascent, at this time the bottom can be used to compare with all the downhill indexes accumulated before the stack, which is the water that is different from their height. The idea of â€‹â€‹using a stack to record downhill, and then dig to the end with a while loop is great. --- ** 21.

Find the rectangle with the largest area that can be found in this row of histograms. Thinking: Finding the area of â€‹â€‹a rectangle is nothing more than finding two indices, then the length of the bottom edge * height. #### Monotonous Stack -The main point is to maintain a monotonically increasing stack according to the nature of the rectangle in the Histogram. -When loop over indexes: -If the height is> = previous peek (), then for that peek, it means, go down, keep going higher, the previous peek can always continue to bottom -When can't I buy a bottom? When is there a downward trend? -At this time, not all previous peeks are calculated, but all previous peeks larger than the current height are considered. -Find all the rectangles from the peek to the current height: stack.pop () -In the process of stack.pop (), the current height is not counted, because it needs to be retained in the next round, and the current index is added to the stack. -Why use stack? Because you need to know the continuously increasing peek, stack.peek () O (1), easy to use   In fact, instead of stack, you can record all heights in other ways, but it is inconvenient to find peek by O (n) #### Knowledge -Understand how monotonous stack is maintained -Maintaining a monotonous stack is required for the problem, not the nature of the stack itself.It is a clever use of stack.peek () O (1). --- ** 22.

O (m): isPalindrome () time. Of course not, then it depends on O (nlogN), or O (n)? #### Method 1: Properties of Hash Table + Palindrome. Compound. O (mn) ##### Ideas -Each word can be split into front + mid + end. If this word + other words can form palindrome, that is to say -Chop off (mid + end), front.reverse () should exist in words []. -Cut off (front + mid), end.reverse () should be in words []. -We use HashMap to store all <word, index>, and then reverse, just find a match. ##### Corner case -If there is an empty string "", then it can be paired with any palindrome word, and it can be transformed back and forth according to the position to make 2 distinct indexes. -This has the logic of `if (reverseEnd.equals (" ")) {...}`. -Note: Although the two for loops that deal with beheading / tailing are repeating records based on empty string,   But because "" itself cannot be used as a starting point, overall will only be recorded once when paired with other palendrome. #### Method 2: Trie Still have to do that. --- ** 24.

The rectangle in a 2D array is also finally made with height * width. The clever thing is, treat each line as the bottom edge, and calculate the height of the bottom edge to the top: -If there is a value == 0 on the bottom edge, then it is counted as no height. -If value == 1 on the bottom edge, then add the above height to make a histogram If you look at specific examples, some rows seem to be calculated in vain, but there is no way.

Will the first mover win? #### Memoization + Search -Like Coins in a Line II, MaxiMin's idea: Find the maximum of my disadvantages -`dp [i] [j] represents the sum of the values â€‹â€‹that the player can take in the [i, j] interval` -Similarly, sum [i] [j] represents the sum of values â€‹â€‹between [i] and [j] -Worst case for opponent, best case for first mover: -dp [i] [j] = sum [i] [j]-Math.min (dp [i] [j-1], dp [i + 1] [j]); -You need to search here, draw a tree to see how it is segmented according to before and after fetching. #### Game + Interval DP, Interval DP -Because it looks at the interval [i, j], it can be thought of as the interval DP -This method needs a review, and it is related to the inference of mathematical expressions: S (x) =-S (y) + m. Refer to the following formula for derivation. -dp [i] [j] indicates that from index (i) to index (j), the maximum value that the first player can get is different from the opponent's number. That is S (x). -One of S (x) = dp [i] [j] = a [i]-dp [i + 1] [j] -There are two cases where m is at the beginning and m is at the end: -dp [i] [j] = max {a [i]-dp [i + 1] [j], a [j]-dp [i] [j-1]} -len = 1, integral is values â€‹â€‹[i] -Finally judge dp [0] [n]> = 0, the difference between the maximum number sum is greater than 0, and you win. -Time / space O (n ^ 2) ##### Formula Derivation -S (x) = X-Y, find the difference between the largest number and sum, where X and Y are the total score of player X and the total score of player Y. -For player X: If the maximum value of S (x) is greater than 0, you win; if the maximum value is less than 0, you must lose. -Player Y: S (y) to indicate the difference between the maximum number and sum for Y. S (y) = Y-X -According to S (x), if you take a number m from the number and X, that is X = m + Xwithout (m) -S (x) = m + Xwithout (m)-Y = m + (Xwithout (m)-Y). -If we simply remove m from the global, then S (y '') = Y-Xwithout (m) -Then calculate it: S (x) = m + (Xwithout (m)-Y) = m-(Y-Xwithout (m)) = m-S (y '') -In this question, when we model X and Y, they are actually dp [i] [j], and the difference is first-hand / last-hand. -Apply the formula, a certain S (x) = a [i]-dp [i + 1] [j], which is m = a [i], and S (y '') = dp [i + 1] [j] ##### Note -If you consider calculating the maximum value between the first hand [i, j], then two arrays may be needed, and finally used to compare the scores of the first hand and the opponent => then more dimensions are needed. -The number difference we consider here just happens to make people not need to calculate the total score of the first mover, very clever. -Trick: Using the difference formula, the derivation is a bit difficult to think of. ##### Interval Dynamic Programming -Find the properties within the [i, j] interval: dp [i] [j] The subscript indicates the interval range [i, j] -Sub-question: behead, tail, behead -loop should be based on the length of the interval -template: consider len = 1, len = 2; when setting i must be i <= n-len; when setting j, j = len + i-1; --- ** 27. [Burst Balloons.java] (https://github.com/awangdev/LintCode/blob/master/Java/Burst%20Balloons.java) ** Level: Hard Tags: [DP, Divide and Conquer, Interval DP, Memoization]        In a volleyball, each ball has a value, and each time you break one, you will score: left * middle * right. Find, how to tie, the maximum? TODO: Need more thoughts on why using dp [n + 2] [n + 2] for memoization, but dp [n] [n] for interval DP. #### Interval DP -Because the regularity of the array changes, it is difficult to find the 'first burst'. On the contrary, which one is the last burst? -The last burst becomes a wall: separate the two sides, consider separately, the principle of addition; finally add the middle. -dp [i] [j] represent max value on range [i, j) -Need to calculate dp [i] [j] incrementally, starting from range size == 3 ---> n -Use k to divide the range (i, j) and conquer each side. ##### Interval DP Three Axes: -Split in the middle -Cut off head or tail -Range as the basis of iteration ##### Print the calculation process -use pi [i] [j] and print recursively. -Print k, using pi [i] [j]: max value taken at k #### Memoization -In fact, it will be a DP that I think about afterwards -dp [i] [j] = max between balloons i ~ j. -Then which point to start the burst? Set to x. -For loop all points are taken as x, go to burst. -Each burst is cut into three parts: the left side can be recusive to find the maximum value of the remaining part on the left side + the middle 3 terms are multiplied + the right side is recursive to find the maximum value. -Note: This is Memoization, not pure DP -Because it is recursive, it is still a search, but memorize the requested value, saving processing --- ** 28. [K Edit Distance.java] (https://github.com/awangdev/LintCode/blob/master/Java/K%20Edit%20Distance.java) ** Level: Hard Tags: [DP, Double Sequence DP, Sequence DP, Trie)        Give a string of String, target string, int k. Find all the dates in the string array: change K times, can become target. #### Trie TODO #### Double Sequence DP -Follow distance for Edit Distance. -In fact, it is to change the function of minEditDistance and bring K for comparison. -The main logic is exactly the same as Edit Distance. -But LintCode 86% test case is timeout. -Time O (mnh), where h = words.length, if n ~ m, Time is almost O (n ^ 2), which is too slow. --- ** 29. [Paint House II.java] (https://github.com/awangdev/LintCode/blob/master/Java/Paint%20House%20II.java) ** Level: Hard Tags: [DP, Sequence DP , Status DP]        time: O (NK ^ 2): space: (NK) A row of n houses, each house can be painted in k colors, the price of each house is different, expressed by costs [] []. costs [0] [1] means that the house with index 0 is painted and color 1. Rule: two adjacent houses cannot be the same color Seek: the least cost #### DP -It's almost the same as Paint House I, but with more paint colors: k colors. -First consider simply using dp [i] to represent the minimum cost of the first i houses -But what color dp [i] and dp [i-1] index will affect each other, it is difficult to discuss, so add state: the sequence DP is added to the state to 2D. -Consider the last bit, and the previous i-1 is limited by the color of the i bit, so when considering min dp [i], there is another layer of iteration. -Do dp [i] [j]: # cost for the first i houses, so we must first pick the cost of the (i-1) house, then find out the cost of the (i-2) house -K colors => O (NK ^ 2) -If not optimized, it is almost the same code as Paint House I -Time O (NK ^ 2), space (NK) -Rolling array: reduce space to O (K) #### Note -The sequence type dp [i] represents the result of 'top i-1'. So dp is best set to int [n + 1] size. -However, the color is the state here, so it remains in j: [0 ~ k) -[[8]] This edge case. Can't run into for loop, so special handle. #### Optimization Solution -Time: O (NK) ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        Explanation ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        - ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---        ---                            ---        ---        ---              ---        ---        ---        ---        TODO ---
